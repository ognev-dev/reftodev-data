# Software describes software

title: Kubernetes
description: Kubernetes (k8s) is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications. Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running production workloads at scale using a system called Borg, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

# Topics of software have some conventions to follow
# 1. If software is only for one or two operating systems then set them in topics
# 2. If software only of specific type (desktop, mobile, cli, web, server) set it in topics
# 3. If it is open source software specify the languages and technologies used in software
#     in format "source:{lang}", for example: source:go, source:vue
#     This is not required, but great to have (often people looking for software that is written
#     in specific lang/tech for research and study)
# 4. Do not add "software" topic, instead expand its meaning by kind of software (database, operating-system, chat, etc)
