# Some notes on software type

Software is a broad term for many entities. For example mobile application and browser extension is both software, tiny utility and operating system is both software. Creating data type for every king of software would be too overwhelming.

Because "software" is a broad term each software entity should expand meaning of "software" in topics. 

Until we have no clear understanding on how software schema should describe a software, here some conventions to follow:
* If software is only for one or two operating systems then set them in topics
* If software only of specific type (desktop, mobile, cli, web, server) set it in topics
* If it is open source software specify the languages and technologies used in software in format `source:{lang}`, for example: `source:go`, `source:vue` (This is not required, but great to have (often people looking for software that is written in specific lang/tech for research and study)
* Do not add "software" topic, instead expand its meaning by kind of software (database, operating-system, chat, etc)
