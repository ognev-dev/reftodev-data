description: >
  bit is an experimental modernized git CLI built on top of git that provides happy defaults and other niceties:
  * command and flag suggestions to help you navigate the plethora of options git provides you
  * autocompletion for files and branch names when using bit add or bit checkout
  * automatic fetch and branch fast-forwarding reducing the likelihood of merge conflicts
  * suggestions work with git aliases
  * new commands like bit sync that vastly simplify your workflow
  * commands from git-extras such as bit release & bit info
  * fully compatible with git allowing you to fallback to git if need be.
