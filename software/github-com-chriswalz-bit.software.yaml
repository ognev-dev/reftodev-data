description: >
  bit is an experimental modernized git CLI built on top of git that provides happy defaults and other niceties:
  <ul>
    <li>command and flag suggestions to help you navigate the plethora of options git provides you</li>
    <li>autocompletion for files and branch names when using bit add or bit checkout</li>
    <li>automatic fetch and branch fast-forwarding reducing the likelihood of merge conflicts</li>
    <li>suggestions work with git aliases</li>
    <li>new commands like bit sync that vastly simplify your workflow</li>
    <li>commands from git-extras such as bit release & bit info</li>
    <li>fully compatible with git allowing you to fallback to git if need be.</li>
  </ul>
