  xo is a command-line tool to generate Go code based on a database schema or a custom query. xo works by using database metadata and SQL introspection queries to discover the types and relationships contained within a schema, and applying a standard set of base (or customized) Go templates against the discovered relationships. Currently, xo can generate types for tables, enums, stored procedures, and custom SQL queries for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite3 databases.
