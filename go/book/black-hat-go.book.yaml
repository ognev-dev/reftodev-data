title: Black Hat Go
description: >
  You’ll begin your journey with a basic overview of Go’s syntax and philosophy and then start to explore examples that you can leverage for tool development, including common network protocols like HTTP, DNS, and SMB. You’ll then dig into various tactics and problems that penetration testers encounter, addressing things like data pilfering, packet sniffing, and exploit development. You’ll create dynamic, pluggable tools before diving into cryptography, attacking Microsoft Windows, and implementing steganography.
