title: Learning Go
description: >
  I've written this book for people who already know some programming languages and how to program. The best way to learn Go is to create your own programs. Each chapter therefore includes exercises (and answers to exercises) to acquaint you with the language. Each exercise is either easy, intermediate, or difficult.
