title: SQLBoiler
description: ORM generator. Generate a featureful and blazing-fast ORM tailored to your database schema. It is a "database-first" ORM as opposed to "code-first" (like gorm/gorp). That means you must first create your database schema. Please use something like goose, sql-migrate or some other migration tool to manage this part of the database's life-cycle.
