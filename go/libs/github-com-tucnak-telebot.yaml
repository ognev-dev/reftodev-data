title: Telebot
description: Telebot is a bot framework for Telegram Bot API. This package provides the best of its kind API for command routing, inline query requests and keyboards, as well as callbacks. Actually, I went a couple steps further, so instead of making a 1:1 API wrapper I chose to focus on the beauty of API and performance
