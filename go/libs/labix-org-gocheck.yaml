title: gocheck
description: Rich testing for the Go language. gocheck works as an extension to the testing package and to the "go test" runner. That allows keeping all current tests and using gocheck-based tests right away for new tests without conflicts. The gocheck API was purposefully made similar to the testing package for a smooth migration.
