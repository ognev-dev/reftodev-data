title: Diskv
description: Diskv (disk-vee) is a simple, persistent key-value store written in the Go language. It starts with an incredibly simple API for storing arbitrary data on a filesystem by key, and builds several layers of performance-enhancing abstraction on top. The end result is a conceptually simple, but highly performant, disk-backed storage system.
