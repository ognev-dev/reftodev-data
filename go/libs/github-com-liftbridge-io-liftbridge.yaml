title: liftbridge
description: Liftbridge provides lightweight, fault-tolerant message streams by implementing a durable stream augmentation for the NATS messaging system. It extends NATS with a Kafka-like publish-subscribe log API that is highly available and horizontally scalable. The goal of Liftbridge is to provide a message-streaming solution with a focus on simplicity and usability. Use it as a simpler and lighter alternative to systems like Kafka and Pulsar or to add streaming semantics to an existing NATS deployment.
