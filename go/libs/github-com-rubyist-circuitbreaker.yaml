title: circuitbreaker
description: Circuitbreaker provides an easy way to use the Circuit Breaker pattern in a Go program. Circuit breakers are typically used when your program makes remote calls. Remote calls can often hang for a while before they time out. If your application makes a lot of these requests, many resources can be tied up waiting for these time outs to occur. A circuit breaker wraps these remote calls and will trip after a defined amount of failures or time outs occur. When a circuit breaker is tripped any future calls will avoid making the remote call and return an error to the caller. In the meantime, the circuit breaker will periodically allow some calls to be tried again and will close the circuit if those are successful.
